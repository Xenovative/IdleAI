# IdleAI: The AGI Moment is Just around the Corner (Maybe not)

## About This Totally Legitimate Venture

IdleAI is a slightly questionable incremental/clicker game where you pretend to train an LLM toward AGI while mostly just watching numbers go up. Your goal is to click buttons, burn investor money, and convince everyone you're making progress.

## "Advanced" Game Mechanics

- **Core "Innovation"**: Click furiously to generate meaningless parameters
- **Automators**: Hire overpriced engineers who mostly browse social media
- **Upgrades**: Purchase fancy equipment with blinking lights that impresses investors
- **Progression**: Achieve "breakthroughs" that are suspiciously similar to existing tech

## How to "Disrupt" the Industry

1. **Click Training**: Smash that button like your funding depends on it (it does)
2. **Hire "Talent"**: Acquire PhD graduates who will immediately forget everything they learned
3. **Upgrade Strategically**: Buy things with impressive names and vague functionality
4. **Track Progress**: Generate charts that always trend upward regardless of actual performance

## Features

- UI that looks just technical enough to fool venture capitalists
- Satisfying sound effects to mask the emptiness of progress
- Milestone celebrations for achievements of dubious significance
- Multiple ways to burn through funding at alarming rates
